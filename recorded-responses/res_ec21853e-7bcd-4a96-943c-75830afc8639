Manage relationships—even across boards—whether you’re building an app, managing inventory, or planning a trip.\n\n## What our users are saying\n\n> Hello Epics has quickly become my most useful Power-Up - it's revolutionized the way I work!\n> — Emily Woods, MotoRad\n\n#  \n\n> Hello Epics solved many of my struggles by providing such an awesome integration into Trello; it was exactly what I needed to be as productive as I knew I could be.\n> — Justin Nixon, Gartner\n\n#  \n\n> Our engineering team uses sprints, and we transferred the work methodology into other areas of the business (like customer success and marketing) using Hello Epics.\n> — Judith Baeta, Paddl\n\nTry [Hello Epics](https://helloepics.com) free for 14 days.\n\n![Hello Epics at a glance](https://helloepics.com/img/onboarding-add-children.a90330d71e1a011645cc.gif)\n\n---\n\n## Popular ways to use Hello Epics\n\n- Share your best work by creating separate internal and client-facing boards, and moving cards across boards as needed. Hello Epics continues to track all related items, regardless of where the card lives.\n- Track feature requests by creating cards for each request and grouping them by feature type.\n- Increase project visibility by sharing parent cards with stakeholders and reserving child cards for your project team.\n\n---\n\n## Hello Epics enables you to...\n\n### Build relationships\n\nNest child cards under their parent — or multiple parents — to create a hierarchy of cards. Link related cards across multiple boards to easily create dependencies, visualize related workstreams, and track overall progress.\n\n### Get more done\n\nJust as there are different ways to finish work, there are different ways to track completion. Choose from three different ways to mark a card as complete:\n\n- Completing all items in a card’s checklist\n- Marking it done via due date\n- Moving a card to a designated ‘Done’ column\n\n![Complete cards and track progress](https://helloepics.com/img/helloepics-completion@2x.3cde70064200611496c0.gif)\n\n### See the big picture\n\nParent cards show how many children have been completed and how many are left. Click on parent cards to dive deeper: see an epic’s completion percentage and which list each child card is in. Navigate intuitively from parent to child and back again.\n\n### Prioritize and update child cards\n\nDrag and drop your child cards right on your parent to prioritize or change\ntheir status.\n\n![Drag and drop child cards](https://helloepics.com/img/dnd.gif)\n\n### Grow your hierarchy\n\nHello Epics works intuitively. Create and attach child cards in three different ways:\n\n- Convert checklist items to child cards\n- Create new child cards directly on the parent\n- Attach existing cards as child cards\n\n![Create new child cards directly from the parent](https://helloepics.com/img/helloepics-attachment@2x.c69028beada85b4d1f7b.gif)\n\n### Work with other Power-Ups\n\nWe’re integrated with two popular Power-Ups so they work hand in hand with Hello Epics: Agile Tools by Corello and Card Numbers by Reenhanced. If you have these Power-Ups installed on your boards, then you’re good to go — there’s no setup needed.\n\n### Protect your data\n\nHello Epics is committed to managing your data securely and transparently.

is created by experienced project and program managers with input from hundreds of teams that already use this power-up every day to save time, avoid mistakes and get projects done across multiple boards within Trello.\n\n## Plan more effectively\n- Gantt charts will help you to visually plan cards, set milestones and create dependencies between the cards, also across multiple boards.\n- Generate a resource plan to understand how the workload is planned in your team.\n- Use card count, story points or effort to plan your work and understand how the workload is planned by viewing it by member, list, label, milestone or board.\n\n## Track smarter\n- Placker automatically tracks the progress of your cards ( from open to completed) when you move your cards between the lists (or assign labels).\n- We will capture the actual start and end date and calculate the effort spent on a card so you capture exactly how your cards are being completed, without any additional effort.\n\n## Report in real-time\n- Dashboards will tell everything you and your team need to on top of your projects,  which cards are overdue, who has to many open cards or the expected completion date based on your throughput.\n- Create (real-time) dashboards to monitor and report the status of your cards.\n- Customize your dashboard by using a library of widgets that support the Agile, Scrum and traditional project management methodologies.\n\n## For any type of project or process\n- When you work with Agile you can using story points, sprint burndown chart, completion chart, cumulative flow chart and control charts.\n- When you work with Scrum you can  use cycle and lead time trackers, throughput overviews and  time to market.\n- When you work with a more traditional methodology we have the trackers to monitor scope, time, effort, budget and risks.\n\n## Works across and between boards and teams\n- View and combine any number of boards on the Gantt, board or dashboards.\n- Export your data to a spreadsheet or MS project file\n- Import your changes from a excel spreadsheet or Microsoft project file\n- Create card mirrors between boards to keep cards synchronized automatically.\n\n### Add plan attributes to Trello\n![screenshot](https://placker.com/power-up/screenshots/Project-by-placker-overview.png)\n[Read more about the

Upon allowing Freshdesk the access Trello, the app will be properly installed and it will send you to your Freshdesk instance.\n\n4. For setting up the notifications options, you can always access the app's settings.\n\n5. You'll need to create a new Agent in Freshdesk named \"Trello agent\". You'll need that agent's API key to setup the Freshdesk Power-Up in Trello. _**Note:** You can use an Agent that already exists and it's an Admin so it doesn't charge you for it, but notifications will be appear with their name instead of \"Trello agent\"._\n\n6. Go back to your Trello board and enable this Freshdesk power-up for your board. Repeat this for every board you want to connect to a Freshdesk instance.\n\n7. Open up any card inside any of the boards and click on the gear icon next to the Freshdesk logo to configure the Freshdesk Power-up. In there, you’ll be asked for the URL of your Freshdesk instance and for the API key of the Freshdesk agent that was created by the Freshdesk admin (the “Trello agent” from step #5 or the agent you chose).\n\nFor more information please visit \n[http://softwaredevtools.com/freshdesk-trello-powerup/](http://softwaredevtools.com/freshdesk-trello-powerup/)","overview":"Deliver exceptional customer support with the Freshdesk Power-up and Trello app."}},{"id":"597b36e988edac3bde38ae70","idOrganizationOwner":"589da26dce9fb791d812619b","author":"UCAYA","capabilities":["authorization-status","board-buttons","callback","show-authorization","show-settings","card-badges"],"categories":["developer-tools","it-project-management"],"iframeConnectorUrl":"https://trello.vince.run/power-ups/project/trello-connector","name":"Project by Vince","privacyUrl":"","public":true,"moderatedState":null,"supportEmail":"hello@vince.run","url":"https://trello.vince.run/power-ups/project/resources/manifest.json","tags":[],"isCompliantWithPrivacyStandards":false,"usageBrackets":{"boards":1000},"icon":{"url":"https://static.vince.run/projectbyvince-icon.svg"},"listing":{"name":"Project by Vince","locale":"en-US","description":"## Bounce between your project boards.\n\n**Create relationships between boards** and **quick jump** into other related boards with **[Project by Vince](https://trello.vince.run/project)**.

The moderator sorts the topics list by votes, and moves the top card to the \"Discussing\" list\n4. 5 minutes to discuss the card, starting with its creator setting the context\n5. There’s a timer: when it goes off, everybody can vote to keep discussing the same topic or move on. Based on the vote, the card may be moved to the “Done” list, and a new one put in its place\n6. Go back to #4, rinse and repeat\n\nIt can be made simpler or more complicated, but that's the gist of it.\n\n**How does this Power-Up help?**\n\nOnce enabled for a board, this Power-Up implements:\n\n- voting capabilities (similar to the official [Voting Power-Up](http://info.trello.com/power-ups/voting))\n    - click to vote (duh!)\n    - displaying list of voters\n    - sorting a list by number of votes\n    - (Lean Coffee bonus!) ensuring people can only vote for as many cards as the rules of multivoting (aka N/3 voting) allow\n- discussion management\n    - start/pause/end a timer for a discussion about a card\n    - notifications (visual + audio) when a discussion timer elapses (visible only to the initiator)\n- card badges and card detail badges, displaying:\n    - number of votes / list of voters\n    - elapsed time for a discussion\n- card back sections, displaying:\n    - discussion status (when ongoing)\n    - a simple UI to vote on a discussion, to decide whether to switch topic or keep going\n\n---\n\n**Card Badges**\n\nBadge showing votes in favour of discussing this card.\n\n![Votes][CardBadgeVoting]\n\nBadge showing elapsed time for an ongoing discussion.\n\n![Votes][CardBadgeOngoing]\n\n---\n\n**Card Back Section**\n\nOn the back of the card, just under the description, you can find a \"Discussion\" section.

We all know Trello is great for collaborating and organising, but until recently there was no way to send and receive emails from in Trello.\n\nSendBoard lets teams deal with their email directly in Trello.\n\n- **Receive Emails** - New emails appear as cards on your Trello board, with smart logic to group conversations.\n- **Collaborate** - Use the processes and Power-Ups you’re already familiar with to get work done in Trello.\n- **Reply** - See the full thread of email messages and internal notes, then reply without leaving Trello.\n\nIt’s a whole new way to think about email for teams.\n\n----------\n\n## How it works\n\nLet’s say you you’ve set up sales@premium-cat-pics.com to deal with your many requests for cat related artwork. Once you’ve added the Power-Up to a Trello board and configured all your settings, you’ll do all of your sales related emailing from within Trello.\n\n**Receive Emails**\n\nAny time a customer sends an email to sales@premium-cat-pics.com, it will arrive as a new card in Trello. You can choose which list new emails should arrive in.\n\n![SendBoard overview - receive emails](https://app.sendboard.com/images/sendboard-how-1.png)\n\n**Collaborate**\n\nWhen you open up the card in Trello, you’ll be able to see the email content, and collaborate around a reply. And just in-case you aren’t available right away, you can set up an auto-reply so your customers get an immediate response.\n\n![SendBoard overview - collaborate](https://app.sendboard.com/images/sendboard-how-2.png)\n\n**Reply**\n\nWhen you are ready to reply, you can put together a rich-text email with attachments. You can also set up an email signature to be magically added to all of your future replies.\n\n![SendBoard overview - reply](https://app.sendboard.com/images/sendboard-how-3.png)\n\nSo that’s a brief summary of how the Power-Up works: Receive emails, collaborate, and then reply - all from within Trello.\n\n------------\n\n\n## Getting Started\n\n-  **Activate the Power-Up**- Firstly, add the SendBoard Power-Up to a Trello board.\n- **Forward your emails** - Configure your email to forward to your SendBoard account.\n- **Customise SendBoard** - Set up auto-replies, email forwarding rules and more.\n\n----------\n\n## Public Beta\n\nSendBoard will be in Public Beta until January 2020. Until then, the product will be free for unlimited boards and users. In January, we will be introducing our paid plans. For customers that sign up before then, the monthly charge will be $19 per board for unlimited users.\n\nWe have an exciting roadmap of features we are working through. And we'd love to hear your feedback as you start using the product.
